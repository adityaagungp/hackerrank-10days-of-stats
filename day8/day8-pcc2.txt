# From equation (1) we know that y = -3/4 x - 2
# From equation (2) we know that x = -3/4 y - 7/4

# Both lines are in form of Y = a + bX. To calculate P we should see its correlation with b from both equations.
# From equation (1) we get -3/4 = P O_y/O_x
# From equation (2) we get -3/4 = P O_x/O_y
# Multiply both, we get (-3/4)^2 = P^2 which gives P = -3/4.
# Negative answer is selected here because the original line has negative slope.

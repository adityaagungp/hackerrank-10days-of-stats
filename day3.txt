# Conditional Probability
Probability that both children are boys is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4

# Cards of the Same Suit
Probability drawing 2 cards with same specific suit is 13/52 * 12/51.
Since there are 4 kuid of suits then the probability is 4 * 13/52 * 12/51 = 4/17

# Drawing Marbles
If the first marble is red then there are 2 remaining red marbles. Then new probability drawing blue marble is 4/6 or 2/3.
